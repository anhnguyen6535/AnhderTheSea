## Instructions:

Click on the link above to play the game.

- The food shaker can be dragged with the mouse left and right to position it over the fish tank.
- Click the shaker to drop a food pellet and try to drop it on top of a fish.
- Feeding a fish will fill its heart.
- Periodically, a cat paw will pop up. Click on it to make it retreat.
- If you click too slowly, the fish will become scared, making them hungry again.
